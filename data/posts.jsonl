Plus his non-kiku vote in 5 player LyLo meant he should have been a possible easy mislynch. Hell, I was expecting him to stick around, which is why I mentioned me and broken being the most obvious town, and that I was unsure between you and Andrew. I figured if I can convince whoever was left as scum (in this case you) to leave you and Andrew around, and try and push a mislynch on the wrong one, I could use the gambit easier. That broken and myself both survived I was starting to second guess myself. So I almost did go for the long winded scum hunting stuff. Thankfully broken not accepting me as obv. town gave me the opening I needed to have a fake breakdown.

I believed the Vengeful would try to kill himself as early as possible to avoid being nightkilled.<br><br>I strongly believed the Mafia would win until Night 5. When they killed the Cop N1 with a lucky shot I was like \"game over,\" even when the town recovered a little by lynching the Mafia RB D2. However, both sides' play dropped somewhat the next few days and nights (Zyrc was definitely the most active scum player, I must admit), and a lurkerkill followed by a lurker lynch were not the best decisions IMO. Havingfitz was the right kill (and IMO should have been the N2 kill) because he was definitely the most obvtownie player in the game, plus he was the Doctor. PranaDevil was the next-most obvtown player, and I have absolutely no clue why the scum let him live to LyLo. I fully expected Prana to be the N5 kill, and my jaw dropped when it was andrew, who (as I noted in the dead QT several times) was by far the most easily manipulated or easily mislynched player. The only explanation I can think of is that Prana suspected Xtoxm somewhat D5 and Xtoxm was attempting to frame Prana, which was inadvisable considering that Prana and kiku cross-voted in LyLo as he himself noted.<br><br>I would like to thank Xtoxm a lot for filling into a slot that was causing me considerable difficulty and playing it both fairly actively and well to the end of the game. Despite the setbacks and shortcomings of activity, I feel this was a pretty good first modded game for me."}

Arguably, the fact that you were actually right about Cecily suggests that you had the information all along - and it was a form of mafia bussing / distancing that you were doing.<br><br>Can you make it clearer to me what your strategy was, if it was a pro-town strategy?"}

Horrible vote for Neruz, on the first day we were in LYLO. The mafia team - if it didn't include NS - could have jumped in to lynch Neruz and the game would have been lost immediately. Six hours went by and that didn't happen ... in fact nobody even joined the wagon. Which suggests NS must be one of the mafia team.<br><br>4. NS claimed PGO. It's far from clear that this fits the possible role described in rule 6.5:<br>\"There may be one other role in the game which will either be Town or Mafia aligned. You might never have seen this role before.\"<br><br>5. PGO is a suspiciously convenient role for a mafioso to claim - as it obviously deters investigations.<br><br>6. If NS is a PGO, it seems odd that we never had 2 night deaths at any time in the game.<br><br>7. Cecily fingered RBT as mafia, with her fake cop investigation. Why would she do that, if RBT is part of the mafia team?<br><br>8. The game seems unbalanced in favour of the town, if NS is a PGO. <br><br>9. If NS is really a PGO, his play has been horrible. Why would you act mysteriously (and therefore suspiciously) knowing that it would be disastrous to attract a town investigation?</div></blockquote><br><br>I've posted a site-wide <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2800977#p2800977\" class=\"postlink\">V/LA</a> but I will do my best to focus on this game because I'd really hate for it to drag on any longer than absolutely necessary.<br><br>To the numbered points:<br><br>1) By \"reckless bandwagoning\" do you mean my votes on Parama? Or my single vote on ICEninja? I stand by my stance that Parama was playing like an idiot. He was the right lynch, even though he flipped town.<br><br>2) Peculiar? Yes. Unconvincing? Perhaps. Truth? Absolutely.<br><br>3) Yes, that vote was a mistake, and as soon as that mistake was pointed out to me, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2784314#p2784314\" class=\"postlink\">I unvoted</a>. I don't know from whether anyone in the Mafia team was online, and at this point, it's rather impossible to determine that. But, I think that fact that no one joined the wagon is rather proof that I'm not part of the scumteam: if I were, there would only be two more votes required. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">[After going back and looking at that vote:]</span> In point of fact, Cecily posted between my vote &amp; unvote; why didn't she jump on that wagon? And, Hiraki posted an hour after my unvote, voting Withnail. Why wouldn't Hiraki jump on that wagon, hoping Cecily would jump back on and I (if I were scum with them) would join them for a quick victory? I can't explain their actions, but this does point to my not being a part of their group.<br><br>4) Let's see what's flipped so far: Two Town Jailkeepers, a Town Doctor, and a Town Vigilante. I'm the Town PGO. In my opinion, PGO is less of a common, widely-known role than Jailkeeper. Your opinion, I guess, is different. I guess this comes down to the perception of which role is less well-known: PGO or Jailkeeper.<br><br>5) Well, yes, which is probably why it's less used (overall), and therefore less well-known, than Jailkeeper. I wasn't thrilled when I got my Role PM, but it's what I've got, and I'm doing my best with it. <br><br>6) Why is it so odd? If no one targeted me, no one would die. VV (&amp;over9000) and I had very little interation; Neruz and I were practically at each other's throats the whole game. I doubt either would protect me. That's the two Jailkeepers; the Doc (sordros) likely would not have protected me, because, again, we had very little interaction. I would think that the Doc would at least interact with someone before protecting them.<br><br>7) Cecily, IMO, played a very poor scum game. (Hiraki, too, but that's a subject for another day.) Who knows why Cecily did anything she did? Maybe it was bussing, maybe not: the point is, we won't know until endgame, if at all.<br><br>8) I honestly can't speak to this; I don't understand balance <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at all.</span><br><br>9) Again, and I hate to keep coming back to this, but I don't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">deliberately</span> play badly, it just happens. I'm just not very good at trying to convince people toward one direction or another, and my play sometimes reflects negatively on my objectives.<br><br>Now that I've spent half an hour I didn't really have on this, I'll have to respond to the RBT case later -- probably tonight.<br><br>Please don't lynch me until I have a chance for that? (I mean, please don't lynch me <span style=\"font-style: italic\">at all,</span> but.)"}

I also like how you say the scum team is me/Andrew 100%, despite the fact that I know I'm town, and if Andrew is also town, he knows he is, which means you've now guarenteed two votes will stay on you regardless. But you still ignore the fact that I was the first one to make any kind of case on anyone this day phase.

I dares you.<br><br>Fact remains that what I've stated about your voting cannot be contested. It's there plain as day. It's also quite plain that you as good as threatened to call me scum if I left my vote on you. Then when I didn't remove the vote, you suddenly decided I \"had\" to be scum, not once did you try and provide an argument to show me I was somehow wrong, you never presented a case on anyone, just stated that by presenting a case on you I was scum. Hardly a compelling case.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kikuchiyo wrote:</cite>Now shut up and let me get to work.</div></blockquote><br>You can still create a case if you wish, but i know how it is to be lazy scum who delays making a case as long as possible.

You said I was town due the fact that I swung the wagon in favor of the roleblocker. Now you are using it to condemn me. You can't have it both ways. As far as the \"voting analysis\" to which I refer, I am speaking about your \"scum wouldn't leave town to finish off wagons.\" Aside from being majorly wifomic, it is also logically incorrect as town is much more likely to vote near deadline than scum.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Prana wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>kikuchiyo wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Prana wrote:</cite> All you're saying is \"Because Prana is voting for me, he must be scum\".</div></blockquote><br><br>Which is entirely legitimate when you put in the context of a lylo situation.

I dares you.</div></blockquote><br><br>Its a misrep because its a book report. There is no evidence that I was responding to your \"pressure\".

Andrew said \"why did you guys no lynch so quick?\" I'm pretty sure there was a curse word in there somewhere too. Thats an appeal to emotion, like saying \"OMG! I can't believe that happened.\" Imo, it had no game relevance, it was a ploy to make it seem as though he had some geuine concern. If you think it wasn';t AtE, thats fine, but thats a difference of opinion, not a logical reason to call me scum.</div></blockquote><br>Except for the fact it's not AtE in the slightest. How on earth is that appealing to any kind of emotion? It's asking why we no lynched extra fast. That's hardly using any kind of emotion to try and appeal to anyone is it?<br><br>Also, at this point in the game, claiming that something was AtE, this close to deadline, is hoping nobody will question it. Early in the day people might look over it, when they might have just one more chance to get online to vote, they will be more inclined to skim and thus not check the information. The fact you falsely claimed things goes to show you can't be trusted, and are, indeed, scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kikuchiyo wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Prana wrote:</cite> claims that I want her lynched if I'm lynched (why would I do that if I'm scum?

I was saying(hence the question mark), why on earth would kikuscum clear two townies at that stage of the game? It makes no sense. And it makes perfect sense to set up my lynch by implying we are partners. You get lynched, then in lylo #2 I get lynched for being your partner. gg, scum win. </div></blockquote><br>Because kikuscum wants said town on her side, and will get rid of one of them before the LyLo period hits, and bank on the other one believing her to be town... oh look, the one more sold on her being town stayed alive. Your second bit is laughable, but cheers for the laugh.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kikuchiyo wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Prana wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">Hopefully</span> broken or Xtoxm can hammer before deadline.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hopefully? Really? According to you at least one of them has to be town. Why would you doubt them hammering? This reads like, you guessed it... an AtE! </div></blockquote><br>I'm beginning to think you don't actually understand what AtE is. But the \"hopefully\" quite obviously stems from the fact that one of them is obviously town, but I have to hope that the town of the two (unless both are town of course) lynches correctly.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>kikuchiyo wrote:</cite>Seriously, all you've done is atack my posting style. I love where you say I didn't provide quotes, but just provided post numbers. Post numbers = quotes. The only difference is that quotes inflate your post to make it look bigger. Something you seem intent on doing, especially as it comes down to the wire. Your reasoning is ridiculous. If broken or xtox has a question in regards to what I meant when I said \"scum sommunication\", they can simply ask. You seem to imply that my posts are devoid of info and analysis, when in fact, they contain a visible and tangible trail of my thoughts wihich can then be questioned, analyzed, etc.</div></blockquote><br>You didn't provide links to the post numbers, and for a fair chunk of it you avoided even doing that. So nope, you didn't provide quotes, nor links, and in some of the cases you claimed the opposide of what was actually happening.<br><br>You also never responded to the fact that you lied, claiming I never mentioned why you were potential scum in my main opening post when I have shown I did. You also claimed there was scum communication between me and andrew, despite the evidence there isn't (which I provided). You then lied about andrew only being suspicious of me late on, when that's blatantly untrue. Throw in that your whole case is putting words in my mouth and stating I voted for my main suspect (something which is ridiculous), hell, throw in that I was on andrew's case so often, yet you've argued that I wasn't, and are now saying we're scum buddies, all in one post, and it's evidence that you are struggling to find something."}

EA's reactions were all over the place and half of the emotion looked feigned, like he was trying to get people to believe he was town because he was yelling and screaming - a la Fate - and then he started defending NE, who wasn't looking good to me. His basic justification for his actions was 'It's not OMGUS as long as I slap a reason on there, whether I believe the reason or not.' My vote, as I clearly said multiple times, was because anyone can slap a reason on a vote and call it \"not OMGUS\" - his reasonings looked crap and like OMGUS anyways. He tried to build a case against TP because \"TOWN HAVING TWO FOSES OUT IS NORMAL. FACT!\" when it's not fact, merely opinion. If you couldn't see him trying to push cases where they didn't exist like that, I don't know what could.

You slid an (admittedly) easy Klazam lynch by, justifying it based more on the N1 flips and his miller claim than any behavior. Again, you cast your vote while trying to resign yourself from responsibility of any lynch that would happen.

I was back and forth on moz until he started getting super emotional and angsty. At that point I knew either he was making some desparate manipulation attempts or he was a poor, unhelpful townie. I was very clear about my townreads at that point in the game, and I had fair townreads on everyone except for rat, moz, SP, and SV. That's on record. I wasn't prepared to vote SV or rat at that point given that I felt they were lurking too much. That's on record. My vote, at that point, was only going to be on one of those two people.

I honestly was half prepared for moz to flip town. That's just what happens on D1 extremely often. The town has no flips to work off of, no night actions or investigations, and a fresh scum team perfectly capable of creating plenty of misdirection. Scum lynches on D1 are just one of those really rare things that you'd be naive to expect. That's why my policy is that you aim for scum, certainly, but if you take out a clear anti-town element, then, hey, at least it's not a total loss. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar 482 wrote:</cite>You've semi-lurked and made it hard for anything to be gleaned from your posting since D1.

It was just really weird. Posts <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2859904#p2859904\" class=\"postlink\">186</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2860554#p2860554\" class=\"postlink\">204</a> are specifically what I'm talking about. His comment to Exilon, some of his points, then saying how a lot of what I pointed out was null just felt off to me and I never really could figure out why.<br><br>2) The reasons Red gave for lynching have never once really been \"I think this person is scum\". This is his vote for moz:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>Either a distressed town or a panicky scum. Either way, if this is his idea of moving forward in this game, then he's not going to be helpful to us <span class=\"noboldsig\">regardless of his alignment</span>.<br></div></blockquote><br>This is a weak vote, and could very easily be busing after he knew his partner was gone. A Godfather busing a goon is all but standard. Notice too that the role blocker was the hammer.<br><br>Here is his vote on Klazam:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>Even if he is just a Miller, it's a good political tactic to just use a lynch on him now.<br></div></blockquote><br>I can't really find anything in his ISO that suggests he had any semblance of a case on Klazam at all. Scum was desperate for some mislynches at this point, and I could see this being used to draw investigation as well.<br><br>The closest he ever comes to actually having a scum read on someone he votes is Space Pope, who had already been hammered at the point.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Red wrote:</cite>It would kind of fit, actually if he was a Godfather role. He tried to get his VT claim out there in a rush to entice the supposed Cop, knowing both that the Cop would not want to investigate a PR and that his role slot was one of the more controversial. In other words, it's like he was trying every subtle thing he could to get that investigation. <br></div></blockquote><br>Maybe I'm reading too deep, but this feels a bit like projecting to me.<br><br>3) After I cleared him as town, Red became practically a non-presence in the game, until lylo where it was clear there is a Godfather. He coasted by completely. Sure spring break might have interfered with part of this, but probably not to the extent that Red coasted. It is exactly what scum would want to do in a situation where Godfather is cleared, anyway. Don't give town any reason to question the clear, and hope they'll kill a different \"cleared\" player.<br><br>I had a 4th smaller point but I forgot it."}

I let it slide too much when it was originally made because, heck, it's the early part of D1. AGar could've been trying to get EA to react to him a little bit. I gave him the benefit of the doubt despite not liking this argument very much. Let's look into it a little more deeply:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 186 wrote:</cite>I wish you would drop this, AGar. There's nothing here.</div></blockquote><br><br>When AGar continues to use the same silly argument against EA going into page 8 is when I start to get annoyed with him. This is me telling AGar that there's nothing here. This is what I felt all along essentially. I don't think I ever once saw EA as scummy, and said, on at least two occasions, that he was rather townie. <br><br>I'm not slamming AGar for being wrong on EA, I'm slamming him for carrying out a tired, broken argument long past its welcome. Do you want to know why AGar was pushing EA for crap so hard going on ten pages during the game? Because his partner penpen/Budja was getting more and more pressure by the page. Check it out:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>penpen 61 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>I like the way NE took initiative.</div></blockquote><br><br>who cares about initiative when its bullshit.<br><br>As you can see here that agar brought this to light:<br><blockquote><div><cite>AGar wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Necessary Evil wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>penpen wrote:</cite>lol<br><br>Erratus, you are quite funny. hahaha</div></blockquote><br>Look, ma! No content!<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: penpen</span><br><br>Usually when people don't random vote they give some sort of reason. Not the case here.</div></blockquote><br><br>Hey look at the scumscum trying to start a bandwagon with false-logic.<br><br>We've got two down! Easy-sauce.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote><br><br>This is a connection you can take to the bank, ICE.<br><br>AGar later criticizes the penpen/Budja/rat role slot twice (<a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2855251#p2855251\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2868647#p2868647\" class=\"postlink\">here</a>), but these are vague threats that remain unacted on until the slot dies. In other words, this is mostly some light distancing as the scumteam resigned to the fact that moz was going to take the first lynch.<br><br>That's about all I found worth bringing up, but I think it's good stuff to be said. To preemptively defend myself given that ICE was always sketchy about me and AGar will likely come after me, let me make a few points. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 75 wrote:</cite>ICE, EA, and AGar have begun to lay the foundation for townreads.</div></blockquote><br><br>I'm quoting this because I want you both to recognize that both of you have always been fairly stable townreads for me. This isn't too important in AGar's case, obviously, but I've said it once or twice, ICE, that I've consistentally seen you as town. This was long before you claimed. Of course a Godfather would have an incentive to befriend a Cop, but I just want to note that your claim didn't all of a sudden get me to say, \"Oh, yeah, and ICE is definitely town!\" AGar, on the other hand, never commented on what alignment he thought ICE was until D4 when he voted Ythan (implying that he saw no reason to not trust ICE's claim). <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 186 wrote:</cite>ICE, AGar, EA, NE, Ythan, Mae, and Exilon all seem like they're on the up and up. plague (Space Pope) is still the best wagon around right now. I wouldn't criticize the moz wagon either.</div></blockquote><br><br>I didn't talk about the penpen/Budja/rat slot because I was still rather neutral there. I wanted people to help me with a read on him. I was seeing him as slight town for essentially the entire D1, but I recognized the case on him. That's important to note because I asked for more spotlight on this role slot whereas AGar tried to keep the discussion centered on EA and then moz. <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RC 286 wrote:</cite>I may be convinced on rat, but I'm having a hard time isolating anything substantial against him and not just lurker-oriented.<br><br>Let's face it, those rat and SV are basically lurker lynches. Especially SV. There's absolutely nothing to read on that slot.<br><br>Can anyone give me a summary of the rat case? Nothing Budja said stuck out at me.</div></blockquote><br><br>This is just more evidence of what I just said. At this point I was warming up to scumpenpen/Budja/rat, I just wanted more from him to analyze. Had rat not been shot, I was building toward this the next day."}

You had some sort of suspicion there, but you never really \"saw\" it, and even went as far to dismiss it as a lurker lynch (bad). This could easily be you having wanted an outstanding scum read on a partner to point back to later (now), but subtly trying to prevent the wagon."}

Not only is one post sufficient to catch scum, but my <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741548#p2741548\" class=\"postlink\">Post 148</a> is about as condensed as a case can possibly get. <br><br>Second, you had just asked me (essentially) the same question: what is \u201cSO BAD\u201d ICEninja?  And I had already responded to that in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2740121#p2740121\" class=\"postlink\">Post 138</a> \u2013 also in a \u201ccondensed\u201d manner.<br><br>So when you then asked me for a \u201ccondensed case\u201d on ICEninja, I felt you were just dragging your feet and being purposefully obstinate.  I was already being short and to the point about ICEninja, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> other players were making cases against ICEninja (see, e.g., edgerobin, HumblePoirot, Oso).  That\u2019s a fairly strong indicator that you were not only turning a blind eye to my case, but to the ICEninja case as a whole.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone, cont. wrote:</cite>I will take note that you are ignoring a very strong case on David Parker, I just skimmed your posts and you have yet to comment on anything I have said about David's play and given he defended you early on for no reason what so ever, to me just makes me more skeptical of your relationship in this game.</div></blockquote><br>Actually, I directly commented on the DavidParker \u201ccase\u201d in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741241#p2741241\" class=\"postlink\">Post 145</a>.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone, Post 218 wrote:</cite>So today David votes me but doesn't give a reason, hasn't really even attempted to make a case on me, and Javert follows him</div></blockquote><br>I called you out as a probable scum-partner for ICEninja on Day One; my vote on you has nothing to do with DavidParker\u2019s vote.  But nice try.<br><br>The case on you is largely based on the obliviousness (and constant questioning) you seem to show towards the possibility of ICEninja being scum, which is particularly absurd given that <span style=\"font-style: italic\">multiple</span> players in the game were making cases against ICEninja.  Furthermore, I felt that in the midst of the ICEninja wagon, you were pushing a DavidParker based on bad reasons (as I explained above in Post 145).  This is enough to vote for you right now."}

Scum can be caught using one post; you do not need a multitude of posts or a pattern to catch scum.  Post 47 is, in my opinion, one of those rare posts that is enough for me to push a lynch on alone.  Your question itself both implies that (i) one post is not enough to catch scum, and (ii) I was not being condensed enough.  Not only is one post sufficient to catch scum, but my <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741548#p2741548\" class=\"postlink\">Post 148</a> is about as condensed as a case can possibly get. <br><br>Second, you had just asked me (essentially) the same question: what is \u201cSO BAD\u201d ICEninja?  And I had already responded to that in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2740121#p2740121\" class=\"postlink\">Post 138</a> \u2013 also in a \u201ccondensed\u201d manner.<br><br>So when you then asked me for a \u201ccondensed case\u201d on ICEninja, I felt you were just dragging your feet and being purposefully obstinate.  I was already being short and to the point about ICEninja, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and</span> other players were making cases against ICEninja (see, e.g., edgerobin, HumblePoirot, Oso).  That\u2019s a fairly strong indicator that you were not only turning a blind eye to my case, but to the ICEninja case as a whole.  <br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone, cont. wrote:</cite>I will take note that you are ignoring a very strong case on David Parker, I just skimmed your posts and you have yet to comment on anything I have said about David's play and given he defended you early on for no reason what so ever, to me just makes me more skeptical of your relationship in this game.</div></blockquote><br>Actually, I directly commented on the DavidParker \u201ccase\u201d in <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2741241#p2741241\" class=\"postlink\">Post 145</a>.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RobCapone, Post 218 wrote:</cite>So today David votes me but doesn't give a reason, hasn't really even attempted to make a case on me, and Javert follows him</div></blockquote><br>I called you out as a probable scum-partner for ICEninja on Day One; my vote on you has nothing to do with DavidParker\u2019s vote.

I started to read through and I kept getting distracted by David so I pointed out his multitude of posts<br><br>3. your response to my \"what is so bad about Ice\" question was this <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>RobCapone, what is \"so bad\" about ICEninja? I think he is lying; and I think he is scum. I read his explanations and I do not believe them. </div></blockquote><br>which is not enough to convince anyone to lynch somebody.<br><br>4. as to what I was referring to about the points on Ice, if somebody is going to convince me to change my beliefs and follow them they need to A. tell exactly what this person did that was scummy and B. why that action was scummy.  this is how I play, I need more than <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I think he is lying; and I think he is scum. I read his explanations and I do not believe them.</div></blockquote><br><br>5. your comments on DP's case were mostly dismissive. When a player comes in during RVS and declares somebody scum like you did, you deserve all the negative attention you got, and his defending you does warrant a raised eyebrow. Plus I didn't see that as somebody who was acting like an idiot, it looked like you knew exactly what you were doing.<br><br>6. yes you called me out as a possible scum partner right after you put your own words inside a quote and made it look like Ice said it (if I was a mod I would have mod-killed you because it is easy for people to mis-understand who actually said it) you have no actual basis for making that accusation other than calling you out for something YOU did that was scummy. I don't care if you put \"this is how it reads to me\" before it, because I missed that when reading the first time, it was only later that I saw that but I don't even care you can call me whatever you want, doesn't mean it is actually true, cause I can assure you it isn't.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #008000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\"><span style=\"font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;\">For the record, misquoting another player is not grounds for a modkill.

I'm still reserving to post some of my other scum suspects at this point while I gather my thoughts.</div></blockquote><br>Another reason he should place his vote on ICENinja (at this point in the game he has no vote out), although he(DP) does state he wants to gather his thoughts on other suspects and post them. But I would like to point out that DP does(sort of) imply in that first quote, that he isn't placing a vote on ICE because his(ICE's) responses are \"somewhat formidable\" but in the second says that he \"doesn't seem to defend himself very well.\". Now I'm starting to get the distinct impression that David doesn't want to vote ICENinja no matter how scummy he looks. Just making cover noises.<br><br>That brings me to my post earlier today: <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750442#p2750442\" class=\"postlink\">Post-227</a>. What David tried to log off as my voting him for MD reasons is actually the final nail in his coffin as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to put a quote wall up so here are the relevant posts.  <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2743223#p2743223\" class=\"postlink\">Post-179</a>:This is where I give my thoughts on two players, David is the second one, last half of the post. Please note, that even before the ICE flip, I thought that David might have been at least testing the waters to see if he could somehow derail the ICE wagon with some sort of jarring post that would take to spotlight off of ICE. The second, <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2750309#p2750309\" class=\"postlink\">Post-219</a>, is where I ask him about it directly. He tries in the post right after that to deflect, at least in my opinion, the vote by classifying my vote as voting based on an MD point rather than actual evidence in the thread. Well, there you go David. All tied up in a neat little package. You were not making an opinion known, you were desperate to get pressure off your partner and you blinked.<br><br>****<br><br>That brings up the question though as to why David was getting desperate to save ICE. As town, David would have voted much earlier than he did. He voiced strong suspicions of ICE twice but didn't vote until he had no choice. As scum, David would have happily thrown a partner in that much trouble under a bus unless there is something about scum in this game that is not readily visible. It makes sense (not optimal play, I'll grant that, but defensible play) to at least try and find a way to save your partner if you are about to lose half your team on Day 1.<br><br>Which brings me to why I claimed. The way my role works make sense in a multi-group game(plus like I said above, I've confused the hell out of myself and maybe someone can point out something in this post that might help me clarify my thinking) and David's reluctance to vote ICE yesterday only makes sense, to me at least, if there is some overriding factor that would make a scum player deviate so badly from optimal play. David's play yesterday certainly wasn't town in relation to ICE nor is it what I would call \"normal\" scum play either.<br><br>Second reason why I claimed: As I said above, my role makes sense in a multi-group game and David has by his play, in my opinion, and pretty much confirmed in my mind that ICE did believe there are two scum groups, for whatever reason, and he wasn't just poisoning the well. So, if there are indeed two scum groups, my action last night may have had a better than average chance of preventing a second kill than a normal RB would as I can block my target's entire group as well if they are, in fact, in a group. I say <span class=\"noboldsig\">MAY HAVE</span> because I can think of several other reasons why there would not have been a second kill when I was expecting one. And yes, I even include the fact that I may be completely wrong in everything I have said above.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">I'll definitely name my block target by the end of the day, no matter what happens.</span>Because if turns out there is only one killing group, my block pretty much clears the target. But we have some discussion out on the table now so I'll leave it up to you folks as to when you want another talking point. If you would rather wait until we clear up some of the current stuff under discussion that's fine with me. If you want it now, I'm good with that too.<br><br>But no matter what else happens today, you folks <span class=\"noboldsig\">WILL</span> have the name of the player before the game day ends, I promise."}

In the case that the doctor dies tonight, I figure both Exlion and I target the remaining unconfirmed player simultaneously, on the expectation that one of us will be night killed. Either way, the slot will be dead, confirmed town, or confirmed scum.<br><br>Worst case scenario and Red/NE is godfather, they can put us in to lylo if they NK exactly right."}

Red would have likely died the next night had you not proposed the massclaim. He's a player I know to be capable of excellent scumhunting and I was honestly worried about him coming around to my D1 bus. The town made the mistake as a collective of not forcing discussion on Days 4 and 5 when it was crucial to get information. I capitalized on that by remaining relatively silent and not having to commit myself to any reads, allowing my flexibility going into LYLO. Had I had to put down reads, it would've been tough to make a stretch towards RC-scum to actually put a vote down in LYLO. NE was almost predictably going to protect you to his grave, especially with you casting potential doubt on Exi as a potential SK. <br><br>TL;DR: Yes, there was a luck factor.

Why did you attempt to refocus discussion as soon as a possible alternative lynch appeared? I still think that you were doing everything you could to avoid lynching inHim, while trying to look like you weren't trying not to lynch him. As for your reasoning:<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>Uh what?

I'll give you this point but I don't think it justifies a lynch.</div></blockquote><br>Overlooking scummy behavior because the player is a newb is very flawed reasoning. A newb scum is much less likely to know theory and tells, and is thus more likely to commit tells. Ignoring those tells because the player is new is a bad idea.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>That's not scumhunting, that's worthless crap. I'm not talking about the catching-up, which I didn't even bother reading because for whatever reason, replacement catch-up posts <span style=\"font-style: italic\">always</span> have a lower signal-to-noise ratio than Glenn Beck. I'm talking about the result inHim ends up at. He called half the living players scum. That's not an exaggeration, I mean <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2944706#p2944706\" class=\"postlink\">literally half</a>. Conveniently, pretty much everyone who was a plausible lynch candidate, save for Valern, showed up on the death list. Then he never filtered the list down to a usable number. Or attacked anyone on the list. Or did anything with it at all for that matter. He just made a preposterous scumlist and sat on his ass.</div></blockquote><br>Yeah, and hey there can be a wagon on half the players in a game on any given day. It's possible to be suspicious of more people than there are scum as not everyone is a perfect townie. Regardless, you seem to have ignored this (inevitably as a result of you not reading his posts):<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>inhimshallibe wrote:</cite>We ought to be lynching one of {Pine, Peabody, Lucresia, Trendall} today.</div></blockquote><br>Now isn't that a usable number?</div></blockquote><br>Its barely a usable number, and he didn't give any preference to any of the people on the list. Saying that you're perfectly happy to lynch a third of the town today without ever narrowing that down is scummy, if only slightly. Defending inHim's scumlist here would have been an odd choice if he had flipped town. Since he flipped scum, it makes me very suspicious.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>crazypianist1116 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>Erratus Apathos wrote:</cite>Okay, I read all of D3 AND RBT's iso in that game, and I have one question: what the fuck does it have to do with anything at all in this game? RBT scumhunted right out the gate (albeit in that stupid cryptic bullshit way he always does) so his situation in that game has precisely dick in common with AMP's in this one.</div></blockquote><br>RBT got lynched for lurking. Before the wagon, he had ~ 11 posts out of 400+, several of which weren't useful, which led people to believe he was lurking. As such, I get a bit worried over jumping the low post count gun.<br><br>I'll start to get antsy if inhim plays poorly today, but I'd rather wait for content today from him before I make that decision. </div></blockquote><br>Using anecdotal evidence to attempt to show that something that clearly benefits scum isn't a scum-tell is at the very least bad reasoning. Clearly, not all lurkers are scum. A slot that lurks across three different players, whose only contribution to the game was a couple of catch-up posts and some theory discussion, and who isn't posting even after he's under pressure is at the very least bad for the town and likely to be scum. If you'd simply said \"I'm not sure yet, I want to see what he posts,\" that would have been one thing. Actively defending him is something entirely different."}

It is one of the most commonly done skills as scum to appear that they find someone scummy but to not actually want their lynch. You absolutely looked like you were doing just this.

Your entire vote was \"I vote for crazy based on reasining that I said <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in my very first post of the game</span>. There are 2 things wrong with this. One, the information was outdated. Two, your conclusion of the slot in said post was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">slightly leaning</span> scum. You can't just say \"alright I'll lynch this player who is slightly leaning scum without contributing anything more to the discussion\". It was a weak bus.<br><br>For the record, I had every intention to hammer crazy, but he self hammered. I made it very clear towards the end of the day that he was the player I wanted lynched, and I made no attempt to shift the wagon elsewhere.<br><br>Furthermore, we should probably be looking for players who bussed. Crazy would not self hammer if his scum buddy wasn't on the wagon already, thus denying him the chance to gain some town cred. Since both scum have flipped goon, we've probably got a remaining power role (I'm guessing role blocker, as it is most common). Power roles usually bus their goons for town cred.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>But I'll let those who've been here longer weigh the risks vs benefits of such a strategy.<br></div></blockquote><br>As I said, it seems like the likelihood of the last scum being a role blocker is way too high to employ this strategy.

It was just a bad vote made by scum, really. They do that to town to try and get bandwagons rolling, which he did. Once he was called out on it, he backtracked so hard.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>and then there's the reason I initially voted him in the first place, which is that he had a scummy overreaction to people voting him. This point is still valid.<br></div></blockquote><br>I'm pretty sure that wagon on me was horrible, and it fell apart for good reasons. I didn't overreact to anything, a significant wagon jumped on me for abysmally bad reasons, and I reacted just the right amount. You never had valid reasons for voting me, and you can't use these to vote for me now.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>NK speculation in his above post.

I fail to see anything useless or scummy about what I said.<br><br>Finally, there is Quilford bringing up my calling out of EA in order to get us out of RVS. Talk about desperate. If you guys seriously think that was a scum tell, I can think of 3 games just off the top of my head where I did the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">exact same thing</span> as town. It is a play style tell, not an alignment tell, and Quilford trying to throw that dirt in my face is scummy as hell.<br><br>Scum knows that I need to die today.

I'm almost positive that scum is between these two, and like I said in day 3, if Ranger is scum, he deserves to win.

Further analysis of Valern's play past day 1 will follow later.<br><br>His vote for me was just terrible. He later justifies his vote with this:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valern wrote:</cite>ICE is scummy because he went into SURVIVAL MODE ZOMG the moment he got some pressure on him. This is not a towny reaction to pressure. A towny reaction to being voted is to more or less ignore it (unless that person is voting them for scummy reasons) and continue to concentrate on scumhunting.<br></div></blockquote><br>As I responded shortly after:<br><blockquote><div><cite>Myself wrote:</cite><br>This paragraph is so bad I don't even know where to begin.<br>1) Lucresia went in to survival mode way harder than I did, yet you unvoted her.<br>2) A townie reaction to being voted for reasons as bad as the ones put on me is NOT to ignore them.<br>3) The votes on me are awful, and I have every right to attack them.<br>4) I do happen to be concentrating on scum hunting, because I'm nearly positive that there is scum on my wagon somewhere.<br></div></blockquote><br><br>What i posted <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2933283#p2933283\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> is still valid. He was on all 3 early bandwagons, and late to boot. If you take my word for my alignment, all 3 of these early day 1 bandwagons he pushed were on townies. This is even worse now that we know the flips.<br><br>Valern also seemed to have weird reads on Lucresia. I get the vibe that he knew she was town by the way he posted during day 1, but I'm having a hard time qualifying this read. However, he definitely did seem to know Quilford would flip town despite my fairly solid case on him, and equally despite Quilford's severe lack of defense.<br><br>Valern played day 4 perfectly. He pushed my lynch, and declared Quilford town. If Quilford gets lynched, he gets town cred and has an easier time pushing my lynch. If I get lynched instead of Quilford, suddenly I flip town and Valern goes back and says \"Oh wow, I guess he must have been right after all!\" and wins the game with the Quilford lynch, especially considering how much clout there was on his lynch.<br><br>I'd also like to note that DRK was the NK. Now obviously she was unlynchable, but she had the more solid stance that I'm town (at the end of day 4) compared to Ranger. Scum Valern would obviously take the player most interested in my lynch in to lylo. Scum ICE would have pushed harder for Valern being scum day 4 to convince DRK to shoot Valern.<br><br>Additionally, most of the reason for lynching me today seems to be about my not having been on any of the scum wagons. Recall that I was the one who asked inHim to claim, obviously showing intents to hammer. I also showed intents to hammer crazy, as well. Both hammers fell too quickly for me to do the honors. That isn't my fault.<br><br>While it isn't that strong of a defense, it's something: most of the now dead townies had a town read on me.<br><br>Finally, I apparently got a lot of town cred for accidentally pointing out that I have no night activity when I was prodded. Everyone seems to have forgotten about that."}

So unless you can actually point out how any of this is scummy, you're just padding your case.<br><blockquote><div><cite>Valren wrote:</cite>And I'm not responding to you for the most part because there's no point in me responding to someone I know is scum except where it might be useful for non-scum to read it.<br></div></blockquote><br>Oh? You \"know\" I'm scum, do you? Then either you're scum, or town who is being foolishly bravado. The burden of proving my guilt is on you. Obviously Quilford doesn't have any real points on me, so if you want me lynched its up to you to respond to it.

Definitely not pro-town, and completely void of scum hunting. Town doesn't actually know who scum is, and therefore needs to put forth effort to find them. You already knew crazy was scum, so you didn't really have to go in depth to find anything. You just knew, so you bused based on that.

I probably should have taken notes on specifics, but I didn't, so here's my \"I don't want to be stabbed repeatedly for hammering without giving an explanation\" summary:<br><br>Valern was the first of the three players I decided I didn't want to vote.  I'd already decided that based on his self-vote, but had subsequently changed my mind and grown paranoid about him doing that as WIFOM.  On reread, Valern's posts just generally didn't set off my gut and had two things going for them:<br>1) His thought process this game has seemed town.  He's done some decent townhunting and scumhunting and his posts and stances have seemed very natural.<br>2) I can't actually remember any of them, but I remember catching a few nice town tells off of him.  That's actually what ended up making him suspicious of him at one point (some of my more recent scum play has involved abusing things that are town tells in the current meta, but really have no reason to be aside from the fact that scum tend not to do them), but I eventually decided it's better to just take them at face value and he really does seem town.<br><br>Truth be told, my ICEninja read is a bit of a mess.  I thought he was town early, was a bit less sure later, decided he was town again, etc, and then made the same flip-flops during reread.<br><br>So while you could say my ICEninja read is overdeveloped to the point where all I can do with it is WIFOM myself, the problem with my Quilford read is that it's underdeveloped.  He replaced in around when I'd stopped paying much attention to the thread and I never got much of a feel for him in context.  In my reread now, I read the thread very much out of order (day 3, day 2, end of day 1, start of day 1, lthe last page or so of day 4, middle of day 1 or something like that (and with varying degrees of depth)) and, not surprisingly, still probably lost a lot of the context.  Quilford really hasn't stood out in his play in any way.  He replaced Lucresia, who looked pretty bad at the start of day 1, but then responded rather calmly to the ensuing pressure.  Her early vanilla claim made me write her off as town initially, but, depending on how familiar she is with either roles or site meta, it could be null.<br><br>If I'm going to be completely honest here, I haven't read Quilford very closely.  My choice of him as scum right now is based more on the other players seeming more town than he does than on an actual read of him.  The big thing that makes me question my ICE read (and it's probably been brought up by someone) is <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2959623#p2959623\" class=\"postlink\">this post</a> and his few after, which look like him awkwardly dancing around inHim's wagon.<br><br>I'm not going to vote yet.  I would like to read certain things a little more closely when I'm less tired (yes, I know the deadline is in less than 24 hours) and then I'll look into placing a vote.<br><br>tl;dr<br>Quilford &gt; ICEninja &gt;&gt; Valern, for now"}

That doesn't say distancing/bussing to me, because as scum it's generally a bad idea to bus your scumbuddies unnecessarily. There was a lot of lurking going on with his slot in the midgame, but hell, he certainly wasn't the only one (hi, DRK). Crazy quite possibly tried to save Inhim at the last minute by jumping on to my Quilford bandwagon (as DRK pointed out), which, even if Quilford <span style=\"font-style: italic\">was</span> scum, certainly wasn't a smart move given that whatever scum is left is probably a PR (ie, Crazy would have been sacrificing a PR to save a goon).<br><br>You are the only person who has never been on a scum wagon at the time a lynch occurred, aside from DRK.

DarthYoshi was probably killed for suspecting inhim/crazy. Erratus died N2, who had probably the best vote on the early ICE wagon, had strong convictions on the Inhim wagon, and called people out for stalling the game around the time just for the sake of \"more information!\" (including ICE, but also myself, although I placed the hammer on that wagon after he said that, because fuck it if he wasn't 100% right that we probably weren't going to get anything else useful out of that day). Peabody died N3, shortly after bringing this up: <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>@ICEninja, in my analysis of day 1, I noticed that you withheld your vote from Lucresia though you were suspicious, but you did vote both Erratus (based on lying to your questions) and on lynchking (due to his single 'scummy' vote post). Lucresia had a good case against her, and I'm wondering why, though you voiced suspicion, you voted for two other people who have less evidence against them rather than never placing a vote on Lucresia?<br><br>I also noticed that you attacked Romanus for voting you based on false premises. After Romanus agreed that the bandwagon was on false premise, he unvoted. However, you asked a question:<br><br>   <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> ICEninja 139 wrote:You haven't given any reason for no longer finding me scum, especially considering how you still feel like I did what you accused me of doing. It looks like a hasty retreat from a bandwagon that is falling apart.</div></blockquote><br><br>This question looks forced. If Romanus unvoted because he found his vote was on a bad premise, why would he still find you as scum? I believe Romanus' reason for unvoting was good.<br><br>In my reread of the case against the Lucresia slot, I realized that there was some merit behind it which makes me wonder why ICEninja never jumped on that wagon. I cannot get a good read on Quilford yet.</div></blockquote><br><br>In fact, all of D3 he was probably the person to say the most in a negative light about ICE, who of course during the night would have been the only scum left at that point. Hmm.<br><br>Aside from DarthYoshi having a thing against me, none of these are people who have particularly suspected me or Quilford IIRC.

That is simply because he cannot defend himself against such valid points, He instead used misdirection to attempt to hide the fact that he didn't defend himself from anything. \"Show me examples\" and \"how does that make me scum\" (when it obviously does, no explanation needed) isn't a pro-town way to defend yourself from a case.<br><br>Valern, didn't you just recently call me scum because I speculated on night kills and was thinking about what scum did and such? And now you're doing it? Have you even LOOKED at my case again Quilford? It is damn solid."}

After Romanus agreed that the bandwagon was on false premise, he unvoted.  However, you asked a question: <blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja 139 wrote:</cite><span class=\"noboldsig\">You haven't given any reason for no longer finding me scum</span>, especially considering how you still feel like I did what you accused me of doing.

I believe Romanus' reason for unvoting was good.  <br><br>In my reread of the case against the Lucresia slot, I realized that there was some merit behind it which makes me wonder why ICEninja never jumped on that wagon.

While yes, I agree scum love to argue theory, we have to take that in the context of AMP's slot. We'll note that his last post with content was made not even 3 days into the game. At such a point, it's more likely to discuss theory as the game is generally just coming out of RVS, and there have been questions raised where theory is concerned. After this, he replaces, Mersaniel makes a single post, and then we get inhim. His posts actually have a decent amount of scumhunting, but they lack continuity which was a result of him catching up. His enitre slot before him lurked a ton, which I'm willing to say is more of a null-tell as a result of <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2868677#p2868677\" class=\"postlink\">this</a> (read to the lynch to find out why).

Quite an interesting read actually. Lots of stuff happened. Kind of difficult to get a sense of time and who's lurking when you're reading straight through however. So here's what I noticed:<br><br>-ICEninja wagon was quite possibly the scummiest wagon I've ever seen. Romanus doesn't read ICEninja's post, and then votes him for reasons blatantly contradicting ICE's post. Trendall jumps on right after him for what seems like no reason whatsoever. We later learn that he never let down his early ICEninja read and was just focusing on getting a read on Lucresia. I'm getting some scum vibes from this as the flip doesn't come until after Lucresia gave her claim post. After Trendall's vote, EA throws down a vote with actual reasons in it! I don't really think it's as valid when ICE comes in and says:<br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>I normally don't like to use meta as a defense, but me making strongly worded votes in the beginning of a game is completely normal for me regardless of my role. I just don't like RVS very much. Your vote on me is just as weak is mine was on you, but your's isn't for the purpose of getting us out of RVS. It's terrible.</div></blockquote><br>While yes EA was being sarcastic when responding to ICE's questions, ICE used this to get out of RVS. No one's going to accept it as a standalone case now, but at the time, it was a very pro-town move by ICE.<br>Valern then jumps on the wagon for, well, you can go back and read the posts for yourself... Basically another bad vote on ICE.<br><br>-Valern's voting patterns. I would have brought up a VCA if ICE didn't do it. Valern has been late on all wagons. The first was copying drk's reasons. The second, I have no clue. The 3rd one on Trendall was somewhat decent but the reasons for voting seem oddly similar to DY's.<br><br>-Trendall: So most points have already been brought up, but to reiterate:<br>Wishy-washy on Lucresia. Bad ICE vote. Current Valern vote seems extremely uninformed and looks like bandwagon hopping in an effort to prevent a self-lynch.<br><br>-Peabody: No vote until page 6, and even then, the Pine case was a load of crap. Further the Trendall vote came out of nowhere.<br><br>I'm open to a Trendall or Valern lynch today as there's an imminent deadline.<br><br>Feel free to bring any comments about Romanus to me. I don't exactly know exactly what he was thinking, but I'll defend him in my place.<br>I'll give some other reads as I go along, but nothing was as blatant as above."}

In context it just read to me like he didn't even care to properly defend himself, so he was going to throw out some name-calling instead and see if that discouraged the wagon on him. I kept my vote on him as long as I did because I felt he was too defensive + defending himself poorly to be town. I feel a lot better about him now that he's stopped being defensive and started doing more scumhunting, but he's still not quite made it to my town list.<br><br>I realize this probably comes a little too late to be particularly useful, but I was looking at the wiki pages of quite a few of the people in this game earlier today, and noticed on Trendall's it said he's always been town. This led me to glance at a few of the completed games, and the difference between his posting there and his posting here is truly night-and-day. Certainly not something I'd give much thought to on its own, but given the fact that he's apparently never been scum before, if this is his first scum game it would make perfect sense to see such a big difference in play.<br><br>If Trendall flips scum I'm going to be taking a very hard look at DeathRowKitty, who has been one of my stronger town reads most of the game, but jumped ship from Trendall's wagon when it started actually gaining a little steam (and also started posting less around the same time IIRC, although from isoing it looks like there's been a gradual decrease all game, so this might not actually have anything to do with Trendall). I also agree with Yoshi that one of Pine/Peabody is probably scum pending a Trendall scum flip, but it should be obvious by now who I think is the more likely scum out of the pair of them.<br><br>And apparently I get rambly when I'm tired. ._."}

All-together, after rereading everything, I'm fairly confident that the reason I voted for you over the other people on ICE's wagon was mostly do to the overall tone and lack of decorum in your posts, which I think is a null-tell at best.

As with many other things, it's <span style=\"font-style: italic\">how</span> you do it, not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">what</span> you do. I do agree that the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">manner</span> in which <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span> has jumped on wagons has been scummy, though.<br><br>-<span class=\"noboldsig\">RotN</span> (love the screenname/avatar, btw) has a mostly solid 129, but I don't at all agree with his <span class=\"noboldsig\">EA</span> vote. As I said before, he's one of if not <span style=\"font-style: italic\">the</span> strongest town read I have right now. 'Annoying' isn't a scumtell, especially if the person's being 'annoying' because of their aggressive way of scumhunting. <span class=\"noboldsig\">EA</span> is top on my town list mostly due to the way in which he dove into the spotlight early on and made efforts to stay there, which isn't something scum are very likely to do at all. (<span class=\"noboldsig\">DRK</span> is high on my town-list for a very similar reason, although zie hasn't been posting nearly as much lately by the looks of it.)<br><br>-My initial reaction to <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine's</span> vote on <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody</span> in post 133 was that it was just... bad. But more on that in a bit.<br><br>-<span class=\"noboldsig\">EA</span> has a post full of self-defense (136) but I think his scumhunting near the end is probably on the right track. TBH I don't think I'd even noticed <span class=\"noboldsig\">AMP</span> was <span style=\"font-style: italic\">in</span> the game until I saw he was being replaced (along with me, ha). Very interested in seeing what the replacement has to say.<br><br>-More solid posting from <span class=\"noboldsig\">ICE</span> (139). I think it may be time to remove my vote, but I'll definitely continue keeping an eye on him.<br><br>-<span class=\"noboldsig\">Yoshi</span> #142: HI YOSHI! *wave*<br><br>- The back-and-forth between <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody</span> and <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span> near the bottom of page 6 is mostly a waste of space imo, talking about stuff that happened pages ago. I have had a brief moment of hesitation about my scum-read on <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span>, though, so I guess it wasn't <span style=\"font-style: italic\">all</span> for nothing. I can kind of see where he's coming from with 145. I'd like to see <span class=\"noboldsig\">Pine</span> do some commenting on people who aren't <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody</span> or <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lucresia</span>.<br><br>-Speaking of <span class=\"noboldsig\">Lucresia</span>, I don't like how she slunk back into the shadows after the pressure went off of her.<br><br>- I <span style=\"font-style: italic\">actually</span> read (most of) <span class=\"noboldsig\">Yoshi's</span> wall, haha. And to respond to what he said about me, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">this</span> is what I said:<br><br><blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>I prefer short, fast-paced games that go too fast for people to get to the point where they're posting walls full of argument by repetition/fluff/quote wars.</div></blockquote><br><br>You cut off everything that I wrote after \"get to the point\", which pretty drastically changes the meaning of the sentence. Why? And how is this sentence any different than the mantra I repeated in our newbie game that \"conciseness is pro-town\"?<br><br>Regarding your second quote of mine, <blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div>\u201cA towny reaction to being voted is to more or less ignore it (unless that person is voting them for scummy reasons) and continue to concentrate on scumhunting.\u201d</div></blockquote> <a href=\"https://forum.mafiascum.net/viewtopic.php?p=2887481#p2887481\" class=\"postlink\">I just got out of a game where I replaced in during LYLO</a>, and the scum were spending most of their time defending themselves and not scumhunting, whereas I and the other not-confirmed town spent a lot more time scumhunting than defending ourselves.

I found Romanus's vote a little strange, and Trendall's downright baffling. I'd really like to hear his explanation for that vote. Then EA jumps on, simply explaining his vote by quoting passages from ICENinja that don't seem particularly suspicious to me. Then Valern started posting random pictures to justify his vote on ICENinja. I can't decide who on this bandwagon I find most suspicious. Everyone's behavior has been so strange that I don't even know where to start.<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote: Lucresia</span> I'm still not sure about Lucresia, but I really don't want to lynch her yet.

I will accuse the mod of lying about the flip before I will believe a Town!Trendall flip.<br><br>But even regardless of Trendall's alignment, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I don't see any motivation for Scum!Peabody to unvote at that point that makes sense.</span> A smart Scum!Peabody probably would have bussed Scum!Trendall super hard because at that point Trendall's wagon looked pretty close to inevitable, and if he was going to not vote his buddy I would think any scum with a lick of sense would have avoided voting and then unvoting. Likewise, a smart Scum!Peabody probably would have kept his vote on a Town!Trendall and then lurked the rest of day and worried about washing his hands of the mislynch vote tomorrow (probably by pushing my mislynch next given that so many people seem to be at the very least okay with the idea).<br><br>This leaves the very obvious possibility that, maybe, Scum!Peabody just isn't very smart. And maybe that's a possibility, but I like to think I'm pretty good at reading people and I don't think he's an idiot, or at least not the kind of idiot that would vote/unvote a popular wagon and then give such a weak reason for doing so as scum. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I've got a strong gut feeling of, \"it's such a lame reason it <span style=\"font-style: italic\">must</span> be true\" going on with that whole \"I unvoted because my vote was anti-town\" thing.</span><br><br>Next, we've got Pine. <span class=\"noboldsig\">If Peabody is scum, Pine is probably not scum with him.</span> Similarly, I will eat my hat if Pine isn't scum, but I'm a little less sure of him than I am of Trendall at the moment. Pine has not only sheeped on cases but spent pretty much the entire game so far tunnelling on Peabody for what were, until very recently, pretty weak reasons, to the point that it got distracting. <span class=\"noboldsig\">I get the feeling the only reason he even bothered FOSing me when he said little or nothing about me before that </span>(despite me making it very clear I suspected him) <span class=\"noboldsig\">was to try to ingratiate himself with the crowd of people who think I'd be a good second or third choice for a lynch</span> (most of whom I think are town, so it definitely makes sense that scum!Pine would try to get in their good graces).<br><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Then, there's the fact of how quickly the Peabody wagon sprung up and the Trendall wagon dissipated.</span> This makes a lot more sense if Peabody is town than if he's scum. If he's scum, then I'd be willing to bet that both of his buddies are probably on his wagon bussing him, and considering there's no way Pine is one of his scumbuddies given his and Peabody's earlier interactions and I have townish reads on everyone else on the wagon except for DarthYoshi, that probably means several of my town reads are wrong.<br><br>This is going to sound incredibly cocky, and I apologize in advance for that. (side note: geez, I end up apologizing for my cockiness in almost every game I've ever played, here and offsite. It's becoming a trend. e.e) But, <span class=\"noboldsig\">if Peabody is scum then, as I see it, at <span style=\"font-style: italic\">least</span> four of my reads are dead, flat-out wrong, and I'm just NOT willing to accept that I've gotten that bad at this game.</span>  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_shifty.gif\" alt=\":shifty:\" title=\"Shifty-Eyed\"><br><br>Also, one more thing. <span class=\"noboldsig\">Peabody dropped something I view as a pretty strong town-tell in the early pages of the game</span>, and it's part of the reason I'm willing to continue defending him now even when half the game thinks both of us are scum. I wasn't going to say anything about my find, because if I tell people I have a secret town-tell, they want me to tell them what it is before they'll believe me, but if everyone knows what it is, it ceases to be a town-tell. But it's there, I definitely saw it, and I'll share it and why it works in post-game if we win. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\"><br><br>----<br><br>I realize that, in all likelihood, no one is going to listen to a word I just said, at least not right now.

In that case, I ask one thing and one thing only: <span class=\"noboldsig\">if you're not willing to listen to me now, please for the love of whatever gods you believe (or don't) in, come back to this post when Peabody and/or I am dead.

No one (Lucresia aside) considered my case though I thought the case was decent.  When I voted Trendall, I saw that my Pine vote was not put to good use because no one else took my case seriously at all.  The likelihood of a Pine lynch was low at that point, so I decided to use my vote somewhere else.

There are only so many legitimate accusations that could be thrown before dumb/weak reasons are given.  The differences between a \"good\" (or a better word would be \"acceptable\") bandwagon/sheep vote and a bad bandwagon/sheeping vote is the motivation behind it.  A bandwagon/sheep vote is acceptable if either 1) the player truly is convinced by the mounting evidence against the player or 2) if the player is trying to put pressure on the accused person to get a better read.  A bad bandwagon/sheep vote is when the player who placed it neither 1) truly believes the person in question is mafia or 2) is trying to get a better read of the accused player.  <br><br>If you do not believe a person is mafia or if you are not trying to apply pressure, I venture to say the sheep or bandwagon is scummy/bad.  My vote was based on neither of those reasons, thus, I unvoted.  It was a bad vote by me regardless of Trendall's alignment.<br><br>However, a person is expected to pull their weight when they are playing this game.  If all a person does is bandwagon or sheep, they do not contribute much to the town and thus become worthless to furthering the town's pursuit after scum.  Scum does not scumhunt because there is no scum to hunt.  My vote on Pine was not based fully on the fact that he sheeped or bandwagoned, but it was based on the fact that 100% of his voiced suspicion was already previously stated by someone else.  He has not pulled his weight, and that lack of genuine scum-hunting led me to believe he is either placing those votes to appear as town or he doesn't want to find scum.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>ICEninja wrote:</cite>Pine, out of context, looks more or less fine. <span class=\"noboldsig\">However, taking his votes out of ISO and in to the game are pathetically weak or sheepish, without having done much of anything to advance the game.</span></div></blockquote><br>This is what I've been trying to say all game!<br><br>Also, I like Valern's post 246, and now Valern is my strongest town read (and this is NOT because he was defending me).

Sorry this is gonna be kind of long.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>DarkYoshi wrote:</cite>Look at Peabody's actual vote--there is nothing except announcing that the vote is L-1 (which is fine, standard operating procedure), and a demand for a claim. Peabody should NOT have been the one demanding a claim, ICE (or whoever stepped forward to say they were willing to hammer) should have been. Peabody also did not give reasons for his L-1 vote, which is telling, since, well, it's freaking L-1. Now that he has Trendall's claim, he unvotes, and, by the by, very diplomatically concedes that his vote was indeed a sheep vote, and proceeds with a whole bunch of gibberish about how really, he's fine with a Trendall lynch, but still unvotes.<br><br>What this says to me is that Peabody put Trendall at L-1 just to get a claim, and that he knows Trendall will flip town and wanted to pre-emptively wipe his hands clean after I threw a little heat his way.</div></blockquote><br><br>I understand your drift here.  You're analyzing my lack of input and filling in my motives.  Yes, I did vote Trendall at L-1, and yes, I did want a claim.  I did not know I was going to be unvoting Trendall at this point.  However, I got to thinking that my vote on Trendall was for all the wrong reasons: I was eager for the day to end, and I was down with the town lynching with whomever they thought was scum.  At the time of my unvote, I realized how unproper it was to vote for someone when I haven't fully investigated him.  The thing about making cases is that it is simple to pick a person and then decide the reasoning later.  If I were to follow through with the Trendall vote, that is exactly what I would have been doing.  It's anti-town thinking, and realizing my mistake, I unvoted.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>RoTN wrote:</cite>Peabody admitted he sheepishly voted Trendall, putting him at L-1, even though he wasn't actually suspicious of him at all. That really reeks to me. Peabody's attacks on Pine all game have seemed a little strange to me. They were incredibly adamant, even in the face of next to no evidence. Now, just a few posts after being called on his sheepish vote on Trendall by DarthYoshi, he's trying to backpeddle off of that wagon as best he can, while still advocating that we lynch Trendall. </div></blockquote><br>Ranger, I still believe my case on Pine is alright although many others disagree.  I believe I was onto something when I pointed out his strong accusation against me and then him unvoting without me posting at all.  I am sorry you do not agree that my point is even valid.  In reference to the post by DarkYoshi, you are right that I changed my mind, but it was not because I am scum.  I am not scum, but my reasons for backpedaling were prompted by Yoshi's accusation that I did not have reasons for voting Trendall.  After thinking about it, I really didn't have much on Trendall.  My unvote was because I realized I was doing just as I said in the above paragraph: I picked a person the town wanted to lynch without having reasoning of my own.  Like I said, it is easy to pick a person and then provide reasons for fosing them later.  I do not want to do that, and once I realized that was what I was doing, I stopped and backpedaled.<br><br>ICEninja's 221: I agree that this wagon has mounted incredibly fast, and I think it's possible scum are jumping on an easy lynch.  My vote and unvote of Trendall was completely suspicious, and that piled on my 'weak' cases against Pine are easy ammunition for those who really want to stalk and kill the town at night (and in the day).<br><br>Erratus' 237 - Your case was that I am contradicting myself.  I agree that my recent behavior has seemed a bit scummy, but if you read my paragraphs above, you see that I caught myself thinking in an anti-town way when I voted Trendall.  I realized my mistake, and I unvoted him.  The difference between my case against Pine and what I've been doing is that I have actually done some scumhunting by asking questions whereas in Pine's instance, 100% of his voiced suspicion, at that time, were first voiced by other people.   When 100% of your suspicion is founded on reasons other town members have presented, it looks scummy.  My suspicions and questions have not been that way except for my recent vote on Trendall which I tried to fix by unvoting.  <br><br>  I do not think all sheeping is bad.  In fact, if you present a good argument, you should expect people to agree with you.  I do not think bandwagoning is bad as long as it is used in a protown way.  My initial case against Pine was not solely that he was sheeping or bandwagoning, but it was that his sheeping and bandwagoning were consistent with the level of his scumhunting at that point in the game.<br><br>In my instance, however, I felt the need to unvote Trendall because I voted him when I wasn't sure of why I was voting him.  Again, this is anti-town.  Therefore, I unvoted."}

What is inconsistent about that?<br><br>Your case is a cobbled-together mess of misquotations, half-truths, and gross exaggerations, taped together with delayed OMGUS and scummy nervousness. You hadn't said anything scummy in a while when I unvoted, but as expected, you took the removal of that last vote as permission to scum it up again.<br><br>Lucresia's case echoes Peabody's, and adds only null tells (like my fondness for walls and the fact that I answer questions when asked.)<br><br><span class=\"bbvote\" title=\"This is an official vote.\">VOTE: Peabody</span><br><span class=\"noboldsig\">FOS: Lucresia</span>"}

And now, my thoughts in rapid-fire\u2026<br><br>Not a lot I can say about my predecessor, he didn\u2019t do a whole lot.  Expect me to be a lot more active.  <br><br>From Lucresia\u2019s #40: \u201cI answered the questions from ICE because although it isn't useful in my opinion, <span class=\"noboldsig\">I have nothing to hide or harm by answering it.</span>\u201d  Emphasis mine.  Scumslip here\u2014only scum feel the need to be so explicit in saying they have nothing to hide, especially when they haven\u2019t even been wagoned yet.<br><br>From ICE\u2019s #51: \u201cI'm considering joining the Lucresia wagon. I'll need to see how she responds to it.\u201d  Why didn\u2019t you join it then?  I think she was only L-3 then.  What\u2019s wrong with putting her at L-2?<br><br>Later, from ICE\u2019s #79: \u201cErratus's lie is very minor, so it isn't attracting lynchworthy suspicion from me, but it is still noteworthy in my eyes.\u201d  That\u2019s some badass backtracking, given how aggressive you were in voting him on p2.  Why vote for someone over a \u2018very minor\u2019 lie that isn\u2019t attracting \u2018lynchworthy suspicion\u2019 from you?  Doesn\u2019t a vote inherently imply that your suspicion is lynchworthy?  Wait, looks like EA nails this in #103.<br><br>Lucresia\u2019s #84: Which lurkers would you have gone after?  You just call out lurkers as a group.  Not helpful for your stated goal of actual catching scumz, so this looks more cosmetic than anything, especially when coupled with your #88\u2014you unvote without re-voting, why not re-vote another lurker and say why?<br><br>Pine\u2019s #90: Why do you see the need to so thoroughly explain an unvote that was doing no harm where it was at?  If you wanted to put Lucresia at L-1, why didn\u2019t you do that assessment on your own and not unvote if you felt Lucresia didn\u2019t merit an L-1 vote?<br><br>From Valern\u2019s #95: \u201cIf you're town, prove it. Start scumhunting. So far, you saying \"hey guys, we should be looking for scum\" followed by you not doing anything of the sort is just adding to your scumminess.\u201d<br><br>^This.<br><br>Romanus\u2019s vote of ICE in #98 is actually pretty sound\u2014ICE was hunting mostly on Lucresia, but has been parking his vote elsewhere.  Trendall\u2019s immediate sheeping in #99, however, is not, especially in light of the extensive lurking Trendall has been doing.<br><br>Valern\u2019s #102: \u201cI prefer short, fast-paced games that go too fast for people to get to the point.\u201d  This is not what I am used to from TownValern.  *stops assigning towncred*<br><br>DRK\u2019s #112: I am also suspicious of how quickly the ICE wagon formed, but picking Valern and explicitly not giving a reason is anti-town regardless of your alignment.  Valern\u2019s vote on ICE is terrible, it is more indicative of an opposition of personalities rather than alignment, but I want to hear your reasons for voting.  You rattle off a list of scumspects and don\u2019t actually say why you find them scummy.  Weak.<br><br>RoTN\u2019s #115: Why don\u2019t you want to lynch Lucresia anymore?  That post is hardly a ringing endorsement of her.<br><br>Valern\u2019s #117: \u201cA towny reaction to being voted is to more or less ignore it (unless that person is voting them for scummy reasons) and continue to concentrate on scumhunting.\u201d<br><br>I actually think it is the complete opposite.  In my experience, townies are more vocal, or at least more insulting, towards their accusers, while scum want to be diplomatic in their defenses to avoid pissing off more townies.  If this is your best reason for voting ICE, it\u2019s a bad one, especially compared to your reasons for voting Lucresia, which were actually a lot better, which makes me wonder why you voted ICE anyways\u2026maybe because he, unlike Lucresia, actually was doing scumhunting?<br><br>Skimmed Lucresia\u2019s wall in #122.  Her shortlist of reads seems townish, but there is a whole boatload of fluff and IIoA in there.  I\u2019m actually thinking she might be town, just not helpful town.<br><br>And that brings us to our current page.  My read on ICE is still neutral, maybe slightly town\u2026when he plays as town, he\u2019s a tough lynch, and he\u2019s defending himself more or less how I\u2019d expect TownICE to, but I\u2019m not yet confident enough in just putting him on my list of townreads.<br><br>Current scumlist (in order of most to least scummy):<br>-Trendall, active lurking ZOMG, his sheepy vote on ICE is incredibad.  Little to no scumhunting.<br>-Valern\u2014this is not at all like what I am used to seeing from Valern\u2019s town game, especially the ICE vote.<br>-AMP, see also: Trendall, re: active lurking.<br>-Lucresia, her early L-2 VT pseudo-claim screams \u201cpanicked town,\u201d and her #122 seems townish, so my scumread on her is relatively weak.  Not totally okay with her yet, though.<br><br>Vote: Trendall.  He could use some extra pressure, methinks.<br><br>Everyone else I currently have on either neutral or town reads.<br><br>@RoTN: Can you give me links to a recent town and recent scum game of your\u2019s?  I need to meta you, but your wiki page seems outdated.<br><br>And I got that all done today!  I\u2019m really something.  I deserve a cookie."}

I'd like to get a bit of information about everyone for my personal reference.<br>1) What is your timezone? This is helpful to know when we're waiting for a player to post, just in case they live overseas. This is particularly important as every hour is going to count in a 1 week deadline.<br>2) What is your mafia experience here and elsewhere? It is good to know who are first timers and who are veterans. Join date doesn't tell the whole story with alts and hiatuses.<br>3) How frequently can we be expecting you to post? Keep in mind the shorter deadlines.<br><br>1) I live in PDT, which is something like GMT -8.<br>2) I have an increasing number of on-site games (not quite 20) and have played (mostly modded) a good handful of party style mafia.<br>3) I will keep up my usual high frequency of large posts.

Did not like the bandwagon against me. Changed his vote to Ice Ninja beleiving his posts were more scummy based on supporting my bandwagon but keeping a bad vote on Erratus.<br><br>lynchking - Posts this game = 1. Has only had one post the entire game which apologizes for lack of activity due to RL but promises to be more active. Agrees with DRK and Erratus' comments against me and jumps on the bandwagon. Despite his promise to be more active, it is now almost 2 full days later and hasn't provided any input to the game besides his jump on the bandwagon including his own feelings on any other player. Possibility of lurking scum although I can understand being busy as I too have had a very unexpected busy week. After the promise of activity without any follow through, I think he deserves an <span class=\"noboldsig\"> FOS: Lynchking</span>. This will however turn back to a vote if I don't see a more substantial post from him soon.<br><br>ICEninja - Posts this game = 18, (You will see a lot more information and notes on him just due to activity). Immediately draws everyone's attention to the day deadlines and requests everyone be very active. He maintains to be very active throughout the game having 18 posts overall. --consistency makes me lean towards town, however the next aspect I will discuss makes me think otherwise. <br><br>He asks everyone to answer a few questions that he wants just for his own personal knowledge, which I assume was also his way of starting conversation and activity. He also states he will be posting walls of texts. Brings up an old game and casts a vote on Erratus based on the questions ice asked. Although he says they weren't used to find scum, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">then contradicts himself </span> by saying someone was lying and that they must be scum based on the answer to a question that wasn't supposed supposedly being used to find scum in the first place.<br><br>Feels the reasons DRK has for voting me are very sound. Then quotes my reasoning for answering the questions he had and beleives that I was trying too hard to look town in my post and considered joining my bandwagon. I find this interesting because again, the questions that were only for his knowledge are being used in a way to help him determine if someone is scum or not.<br><br>Mentions he also thinks Pine is trying to hard to not look like he is sheeping but does not feel it is enough to change his vote from Erratus.<br><br>Mentions that the activity in this game is low and brings up the following as people who haven't posted much or posted anything he feels is worthwhile: Valern, Trendall, Romanus, &amp; AMP. Does NOT mention LynchKing who hasnt even posted at all! Possible scum buddy? But wait, makes a post the next day after lynchking makes his first post and identifies all the obvious things Ive already stated in this post (1 post, jumps on bandwagon) and changes his vote to him. I wonder though how heartfelt this vote really is. I think that his response to romanus the next day might be <span style=\"font-style: italic\">him </span> trying too hard to look like he isnt interested in my bandwagon nor still voting for erratus for no good reason. Then again as soon as I feel he might be scum, the next things he does seem town to me...he thinks valern has a bad mindset by wanting to just quick lynch me anyways (agreed btw...a quick lynch with barely any information is NOT a town mindset at all). He then confirms his previous posts throughout the game that he doesn't think anything Ive done or said yet is lynchworthy yet, just suspicious. Then decides after going back and forth a bit that Valern's bandwagon jumping You are a hard one to get a read on..that's for sure.<br><br>Trendall -posts this game = 7, I beleive the low activity was only due to his V/LA. Brought up some good points concerning what he felt about my posts and my bandwagon. He also based off that was not entirely sure that I was the right choice.He pointed out a few things he didn't like while ommitting things that had already been covered *(I like this because it allows you to want to read his posts and not just skim since the content is fresh and there is actual thought provoking ideas to consider. He also brings rangerofthenorth into the picture who accussed trendall of being strongly behind my wagon and even for voting for me which never happened. Neither of those 2 things were true based on Trendall's posts. I am pretty confident Trendall is town.<br><br>Erratus Apathos - posts this game = 10, answered ICE's questions but the answer's were obviously sarcastic. Voted peabody for being \"nervous scum\" which he later explains why he thought he acted like nervous scum, good enough for a first vote. Then gave a bs answer to a bs accusation ICE had based on him \"lying \" which was really just him being sarcastic to his questions. Then just said he agreed with DRK's post and hopped on my bandwagon. Then he is thoroughly convinced that I am scum and keeps urging people to vote for me and hop on my bandwagon. Then after my claim, erratus agrees with Romanus that he does not think my post was a scum gambit and unvotes me to vote for ice ninja based on thinking that his \"lie\" is noteworthy. (a \"lie\" which still was just frickin sarcasm from a game that shouldnt have been brought up since its ongoing anyways and ice hasn't dropped it yet) . Either way I can't get a good read on him. <br><br>RangeroftheNorth - posts this game = 13, answer's ICE's questions and discusses he prefers night 0's due to any information is better than none and more information = less chance of mafia manipulation. All these are fair statements. He then goes on to explain the congratulating the doctor tell and agrees with DRK's case on me. Then hops on the bandwagon. Then nitpicks and asks for clarification on something Erratus said. I think it was clear what Erratus meant, but perhaps ranger just wanted to post for the sake of posting? I can't imagine who really needed clarification on that statement..He then explains why he asked it but...it still seems strange to me. Regardless, strange doesnt necessarily mean scum. The rest of his posts are really saying that he finds me suspicious still but is not sure about me after my claim and unvotes. Then admits that re-reading trendall's posts he was far off on his analysis. He also does not see a reason for a case against ice ninja. Overall I am leaning towards town based on his activity and scum hunting posts he has made.<br><br>Peabody - posts this game = 6, answered ICE's questions, questions AMPs late RVS vote and erratus points out he beleives that is a nervous scum comment.He questions the validity of erratus post (valid imo) peabody thinks pine might be afraid to jump on my bandwagon but agreeing with the bandwagon calling him inconsistent. This is a good read imo. I am leaning towards Peabody being town, but would like to see a bit more action from him.<br><br>Valern - posts this game = 9, made a few comments on his playstyle probably spawned from ICE's questions but he didnt answer them directly. Liked DRK's case on me as well as Romanus' vote on Pine. He then decided I was probably the best choice to hop on as a bandwagon and hopped on. Doesnt post unless he has something worthwhile to say and skims walls. So he may or may not even be reading this <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\"> He likes Romanus' posting and questions ICE on whether he thinks less posts = scummy. even after claiming he feels I would be a good lynch if I dont show \"improvement\" even though thusfar he had barely posted and jumped on a bandwagon himself. So what I have from Valern is that he wants a quick lynch which is VERY anti-town as it does not allow us to gather any information which is essential on day 1. Valern then decided I can wait due to an over-reaction from ICEninja. He keeps mentioning in a few of his additional posts that everyone shoudld be looking for scum yes I really dont think he's doing a good job. IMO he's trying to seem hepful to the town without actually being helpful. Pretty confident he's scum.<br><br>DeathRowKitty - posts this game =17, makes random vote, then switches to a pretty much other random vote, doesnt mind larger posts as long as it is not all the time, then he would skim through. Didnt seem to like having a night 0 or any of ICE's questions. Started a bandwagon on me from things I considered to be pointless or irrelevant however I think with nothing to go off of, it probably was good enough for day 1. Made several osts to me and others ecplaining his reasoning. He endorsed the lynch based on his reasonings and tried to get other people on his bandwagon. After my claim he no longer agreed with the wagon and unvoted. He doesnt like the ICE wagon and says AMP, Trendall and Valern were peaking his scumdar next. Then voted for Valern stating he was too cool to give a reason. He also critisizes Erratus for his quoting of ICE and considering everything ICE says to pretty much be scummy. I think DRK is town based on the quality of most of his posts thusfar. I think he has good intentions in this game.<br><br>Pine - posts this game = 14, pro-wall, answers questions from ICE, calls out the dumb comment made from ranger of the north (who was asking for clarification on a stupid statement...), liked my bandwagon but decided he'd rather keep his vote on peabody for some extra pressure. Then rescinds his feelings that the post was dumb since ranger didnt get ofended..I think Pine is acting scummy and inconsistent. Unvoted peabody then decided he was going to re-read the thread and maybe put me at L-1 the next morning, which he never made another comment. I am leaning towards him being a following piece of scum. I'd actually go with pretty confident.<br><br>AMP - posts this game = 5, Answered ICE's questions, Discusses that he hates night 0 and why. Posts to tell us he forgot about this game and is reading now and will give opinions.Discusses why a townie may lie in response to the whole erratus thing. Then disagrees that the congrats to the doctor tell is a valid scum tell. Then says I had an OMGUS vote (not sure what this was about since I didn't have one?) but decides to sit back and let other people pressure me since they were dong a good enough job (I think that's more lurking..keep providing input please..if you have questions..ask them.) Then discusses that he feels ong posts pretty much usually contain fluff. Then goes back on a V/LA for 48 hrs due to a family emergency. Not much going on here since most of the time he has not been in the game. So the only confusing thing to me was the comment on the OMGUS vote which he thinks I made that I didnt. Perhaps he was reaching at air trying to think of something to bring to the table. Either way I dont have a good enough read on him."}

I agree that RangeroftheNorth's #44 was an incredibly awkward post. To me it seemed like he was trying to imply that Erratus has made a gigantic scumslip, when he quite obviously hadn't. It's an especially weird post seeing as Ranger acknowledges that there's an alternative way to interpret that sentence which is quite obviously the right one in his post. I also don't like ICENinja voting Erratus for lying, when it was really really painfully obvious that Erratus was just joking. Accusing someone of 'lying' like that, especially when it's a joke and completely irrelevant is just such an easy argument for scum to construct. Same with 'you are acting slightly differently in this game then you are to another game'. People's behaviour changes over games for a multitude of different reasons, and again, pointing out 'contradictions' like this that are totally irrelevant is something that scum like to do from my experience.<br><br>I really wish I could add more, but it seems like all my points have already been covered"}

If we had won, it would have represented a massive comeback. Anyhow, I don't think there was much chance of getting a lynch through on Vollkan on D5, even if the possibility was suggested, partly because he played very well for the first four days and partly because of the inherent improbability of him being a role blocker and the unclear mechanics that double role blocking involves. I think it would have been extremely difficult to implicate Vollkan based the possibility that he MIGHT be a roleblocker, when the simpler and likelier explanation by far was that I was scum. I would certainly support a site wide effort to clarify power role resolutions in an effort to avoid any confusion in the future.
