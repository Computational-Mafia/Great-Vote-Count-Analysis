PM me if you have any concerns about a players\\' actions.<br>5) All text must be readily readable, in legible script, and fully visible. No encrypted or otherwise coded text.<br>6) I call the shots, but if you feel I make a mistake or have a question - PM me or bold @mod in thread.<br>7) Do not quote any PM sent by me to you that regards this game. Paraphrasing is fine.<br>9) I prod every 48 hours. I give you 24 hours to respond, or I give you a hard-prod (Another prod basically), to which you have 12 hours to respond or I will begin searching for a replacement. If you return before I find a replacement, you\\'ll be fine. Otherwise, you\\'re gone when I say you are. If you need some time, V/LA or PM me and say so, I can make an exception for a little while longer.<br>10) <span class=\"noboldsig\"><span style=\"color: #FF4000\"><span class=\"nocolorsig\">Bold Orange</span></span></span> is my color as moderator. Don\\'t even think about pretending to be me. Not even jokingly.<br>11) Vote by using either the \\'bold\\' or \\'vote\\' tags. Please be clear about the player (nicknames are okay if they are close enough). If I don\\'t understand you, I won\\'t count the vote. If I think you\\'re making a vote, I will count it.<br>12) Lynches happen when &gt;50% of the votes are on a player. You may discuss until I close the thread.<br>13) Day phases are 2 weeks, night phases are 48 hours -or- when I have all night actions.<br>14) My final rule is this: Don\\'t be a jerk. That\\'s not to say you can\\'t play aggressively, but do no personally insult someone, someone\\'s family, or use excessive/racist comments. I have 0 tolerance for such things, and it -will- earn you a modkill.</fieldset>'},\n",

Right now it belongs on Aeronaut under this schema, so <br><span class=\"noboldsig\">Unvote <br>vote Aeronaut</span><br><br>However, I do have suspicions. I think the truest scumtells are bouts of uncertainty or a lack of confidence or integrity, so I flagged zakk, Aeronaut, and SilverWolf because they had the most posts that fit those standards. Recent examples for each:<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">zakk</span><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>In <a href=\"http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6971079#p6971079\" class=\"postlink\">post 136</a>, zakk wrote:</cite>It\\'s cool, I knew it was fake because I remembered you were already on my wagon.

The game is yet young, and I would really appreciate being kept around a while. Yes, this is a shameless appeal to emotion.<br><br>Anyway, as stated in my signature, I\\'ll be V/LA for most of today and tomorrow, so take a couple votes off me, let some stuff happen in the game, let me get a feel for what kind of posting is or isn\\'t \"okay\" (because clearly I\\'m being far too snarky or something), and I\\'ll be back to comment on everything on Monday at the latest, even though I\\'ll likely be able to get on a few times in the next few days.<br><br>Thanks, from the bottom of my heart.

You have a serious vote on Zakk. What didn\\'t you like about his attitude? Also, \"his posts are lacking\" seems vague to me. I mean, if you look my posts, I don\\'t think I\\'d said much really at that point either. You didn\\'t feel the need to vote me? Or pressure me? Look at Mahonster, who is still in RVS apparently.

But the initial question posed by SilverWolf presents it as an either/or, with one positive option and one negative option. It is manipulative, and any way Mahonster answer paints him in a bad light. If it\\'s a serious vote, Mahonster then has to explain his reasoning, and the lack of reasoning from the get-go is going to raise suspicion. Claiming the second, of course, looks negative as many players in this game would say blatantly keeping the game in RVS is not a town thing to do. And a middling answer feels non-commital and weak. SilverWolf\\'s question trapped Mahonster in a situation to which there are no completely reasonable explanations or positive outcomes.</div></blockquote><br><br>No it did not because he said it was RVS but he was ready to get serious.

So no, any answer he gave did not put him in a bad light since his answer was fine.<br><br>Again, you are nitpicking word choice and assigning untrue motives to what I was trying to do.

I also think if he is 1-shot, there's a good chance he'll hit town with his action. OTOH, I am adverse to lynching claimed PR's when we can possibly test it to verify it's accuracy. <br><br>zakk, I thought pretty strongly in the beginning was playing as town VT, BUT after all that suspicion was put on him, his play changed. He didn't post much, he started using excuses-suddenly can't get into the game, and Aero is absolutely right that forcing another claim is a bad idea. In fact, we really should only be putting people to L-1 and forcing a claim if we are sure we are going to lynch them. <br><br>Grimm is suspicious to me as well. His ISO is pretty bare and even when he does comment, he doesn't say much. <br><br>I think there is likely scum in the lurkers. It just makes sense. I've seen that in games before where there is a mix-proactive, lurky, in between, etc. <br><br>BlockyMan is another one I'm suspicious of for his atrocious ISO and lack of content.<br><br>Billi I'm only mildly suspicious of due to the L-1's as that seems anti-town but that's about it there.\"},\n",

Cheetory and Vettrock are helping out with the modding too though, so it should be real fun. Gonna invite all the original players plus some of ones who could make it. Plus new people o/c. I'm p excited<br><br><br>P-edit: Oh, Game of Thrones mafia! Yea don't worry, that project will continue soon enough. I just am gonna have to make some serious tweaks to it though, and I also sort of decided I want to run a large and test some things first before taking something like that on. The most players I've ever had is 13 and as you know, that game has a crazy convoluted setup which is gonna take some serious fleshing out.<br><br>Also, I think by running another large first, I might be able to push the player count past 21 and have like 22 or 23, so I can add some of the characters we had to cut\"},\n",
